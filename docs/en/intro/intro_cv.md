## 1. Cyclic voltammetry principle

Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is arguably the most widely used electrochemical method for acquiring qualitative information about electrochemical reactions.

It involves scanning the potential of a working electrode at a constant rate $v$ between two limits, while measuring the resulting current. The graph of current versus potential is called a **voltammogram**.

## 2. Impedance spectroscopy principle

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is complementary to CV: it operates in the **frequency domain**. A small sinusoidal perturbation ($\Delta E = 10$ mV) is applied, and the current response (amplitude + phase shift) allows construction of the complex impedance $Z(\omega)$.

**Nyquist** and **Bode** diagrams reveal resistances (solution, charge transfer, passive film) and capacitances (double layer) that are inaccessible through CV.

## 3. Modeling challenges

Numerical simulation allows us to:
1. Predict the shape of current peaks as a function of scan rate (CV)
2. Diagnose the presence and properties of passive films
3. Separate resistive and capacitive contributions of the interface (EIS)
4. Quantify the influence of pH and composition on electrochemical behavior

In this project, two complementary studies cover:
- **Study 1**: cyclic voltammetry on an **Au electrode with Ni and Cu impurities**, with surface oxides and Langmuir model
- **Study 2**: impedance spectroscopy on the same electrode, with adaptive equivalent circuit
